# Titanic: Machine-Learning from Disaster
Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics

This project comprises of a model which predicts which of the passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

This includes basic data preprocessing steps like filling of NaN values and segregation of important attributes.

I have tried many classifiaction model out of which some gave best results. 

As this is an kaggle problem i got an accuracy of about 78%.
